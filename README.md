Current project is my first ever work on Python.
There are five different math games, which can help you to warm your brain a little :)

Minimum required software to install the project is:

- Python 3.10

To install and start games you need to download build and then run following actions:

-make package-install

To play each game you need to run following actions:

- brain-even
- brain-calc
- brain-gcd
- brain-progression
- brain-prime

Below there are demo, rec by asciinema, for each game to see how it works.
